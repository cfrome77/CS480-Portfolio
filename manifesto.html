<h2>Manifesto</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Through this course in HCI/Interaftion Design, I have learned a lot about how user-centered design changes the way we view and create technology. By placing humans at the core of the design and development we are to better create products that actually meet the needs of those who will be using it. I have been able to learn a new design philosophy that has a much more user focused approach to it, how I can create things that will actually be useful.</p>

<p>Over the course of the semester, we completed many different projects that have focused on the different aspects of the designs. Having taken HCI, I’ve come to learn what I believe to be the essence of good design. I have come to learn the importance of people in design, something that others classes have not taught or emphasized.</p>

<p>I have been able to identify several key components of what I believe makes up a successful design process through my various work over the past several months. In short, they are the following:
  <ul>
  <li>Develop an audiance and purpose statement (why and for whom is this product being designed?)</li>
  <li>Understand your target audiance (observations/interivews)</li>
  <li>understand that the process is iterative</li>
  <li>Make use of the MVP technique, with user testing/feedback event at the early stages</li>
  <li>Reflect on on and incorporate user feedback in the next iteration of the design</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>The Importance of Sketching</h2>
<p>
Throught the course of the semester I have learned the importance of sketching in the design process.
</p>

<h2>Concept Statements</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://medium.com/@fromeca/concept-statement-jmu-cs-480-8df25ae259bf" target="_blank"><img align="right" height="200" width="200" src="assets/img/MyBurg.jpeg" alt="Downtown Harrisonbrug, VA"/></a>
Our design process in the class began by thinking of a need that people have or how a specific task could be made better. This led to the development of concept statements, which oulined the need that our product would address and the types of features our poduct would include to address those needs. This was the audiance and purpose statement for our product, which stated what users can do with it, and why it’s useful (what problems it solves). This is the first step in the development process. 
</p>

<h2>Undersanding Your Target Audiance</h2>
<p>
The next part of the design process is to begin to understand your targe audinace. By understanding our traget audiance you will better able to better create a product that will dirrectly address there needs. In order to get t know the target audiance for our project we conducted interviews and did observation of what we believed to the target audiance(s) for our project. These interviews allowed us to ather informaion form potential users that we would help us in creating ou projects. These interviews were a way to gather the data that would help us build the list of requirements for our project. By directly observing/interviewing potential users we are able to focus on what users want rather than guessing what the want or using an sort of preconsieved notions.</p>
