<h2>Manifesto</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Through this course in HCI/Interaftion Design, I have learned a lot about how user-centered design changes the way we view and create technology. By placing humans at the core of the design and development we are to better create products that actually meet the needs of those who will be using it. I have been able to learn a new design philosophy that has a much more user focused approach to it, how I can create things that will actually be useful.</p>

<p>Over the course of the semester, we completed many different projects that have focused on the different aspects of the design process. Having taken HCI, I’ve come to learn what I believe to be the essence of good design. I have come to learn the importance of people in design, something that others classes have not taught or emphasized.</p>

<p>I have been able to identify several key components of what I believe makes up a successful design process through my various work over the past several months. In short, they are the following:
  <ol>
  <li>Develop an audiance and purpose statement (why and for whom is this product being designed?)</li>
  <li>Understand your target audiance (observations/interivews)</li>
  <li>understand that the process is iterative</li>
  <li>Make use of the MVP technique, with user testing/feedback even at the early stages</li>
  <li>Reflect on on and incorporate user feedback in the next iteration of the design</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>The Importance of Sketching</h2>
<p>
Throught the course of the semester I have learned the importance of sketching in the design process. The importance of sketching was emphasized even at the very begining of the class. Sketching is an excellent way to quickly explore concepts. Through sketching you are able to easily test many ideas without the overhead of startig over. Sketching first is a way to propose, refine, communicate and critique your ideas in a way that can easily be understood by others. Later, as we have done in this class, you can use low-fidelity prototypes to test broad concepts and specific features of you design. The more you sketch the easier it will be to arrow down you focus, making the next steps in the design process that much easier.

<h2>Concept Statements</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://medium.com/@fromeca/concept-statement-jmu-cs-480-8df25ae259bf" target="_blank"><img align="right" height="200" width="200" src="assets/img/MyBurg.jpeg" alt="Downtown Harrisonbrug, VA"/></a>
Our design process in the class began by thinking of a need that people have or how a specific task could be made better. This led to the development of concept statements, which outlined the need that our product would address and the types of features our poduct would include to address those needs. This was the audiance and purpose statement for our product, which stated what users can do with it, and why it’s useful (what problems it solves). This is the first step in the development process. My concept statement for MyBurg can be seen by clicking the image to the right.

<h2>Understanding Your Target Audiance</h2>
<p>
The next part of the design process is to begin to understand your target audience. By understanding your traget audiance you will better able to create a product that will dirrectly address there needs. In order to get to know the target audiance for our project we conducted interviews and did observation of what we believed to be the target audiance(s) for our project. These interviews allowed us to gather information form potential users that would help us in creating our projects. These interviews were a way to gather the data that would help us build the list of requirements for our project. By directly observing/interviewing potential users we are able to focus on what users want rather than guessing what the want or using an sort of preconsieved notions.</p>
